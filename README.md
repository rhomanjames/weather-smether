# weather-smether

I had a lot of fun building this project!

I wanted to get familiar with APIs, and what better way to do that than with the ol' weather app, right?

To build this, I used HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

The UI simple and I focused more on how to properly integrate the API. 

This gave me the courage to tackle tougher APIs, like Google, which you can see in my googly-moogly project
